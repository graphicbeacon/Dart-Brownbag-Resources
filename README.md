Dart Brownbag Resources
===============

A showcase of demos based on the Dart programming language

To get started you need to setup Dart:
* Download and unzip the Dart bundle at http://dartlang.org/tools/download.html
* Add the dart-sdk folder to your $PATH environment variable
* Open Dart Editor in the downloaded folder

For use with Dart Editor:
* Go to **File > Open Existing Folder**
* Select any of the folders in this repo

To install the required packages(_needed for Case Demos_) using Dart Editor:
* Open the pubspec.yaml file
* Make a change and save the file for Dart to pull in the needed dependencies

If not using Dart Editor, you can browse to the Case Demos folder via the Terminal or Command Prompt and simply run:
```
pub get
```

Enjoy!
